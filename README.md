# Globsyn Finishing School ‚Äì Internship (2023)

This repository contains my work during the **Globsyn Finishing School Internship (2023)**.  
It includes basic Python practice codes and a small Machine Learning mini project on disease prediction.  

## üìå Contents
- **Basic Python Codes**:  
  Practice programs to strengthen understanding of Python programming, including:
  - Data types and operators
  - Control flow (loops, conditionals)
  - Functions and modules
  - File handling
  - Intro to Pandas and NumPy

- **Mini Project ‚Äì Disease Prediction**:  
  A simple machine learning project where I applied basic ML algorithms to predict the likelihood of a disease.  
  - Preprocessed dataset using Pandas & NumPy  
  - Implemented Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models using Scikit-learn  
  - Evaluated model performance with accuracy score  

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib (for simple visualizations)

## üôå Acknowledgment
This work was completed as part of my internship at **Globsyn Finishing School (2023)**, where I gained hands-on experience with Python programming and introductory machine learning concepts.
